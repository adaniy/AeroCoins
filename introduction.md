West Africa is facing a shortage of qualified pilots due to a lack of pilot training facilities and high aviation costs. To address this situation, we are launching AEROCOINS, a utility token based on blockchain that aims to create an aviation club in Lom√©, Togo. This club will offer affordable and inclusive access to pilot training and aviation services, contributing to the sustainability and social responsibility of the project.
