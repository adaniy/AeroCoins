# Enhanced Sustainability and Social Responsibility

AEROCOINS is committed to respecting the environment, economy, and society, using environmentally-friendly blockchain technology, supporting the local economy, and promoting social inclusion for disadvantaged populations.

AEROCOINS uses a Proof of Stake blockchain technology, which consumes less energy than the Proof of Work used by most cryptocurrencies. Proof of Stake validates transactions and creates new blocks based on the quantity of tokens held by participants, reducing energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and the project's environmental impact.

AEROCOINS also supports the local economy by creating jobs, boosting tourism, and enhancing infrastructure. The project will generate direct and indirect jobs in the aviation sector, including instructors, mechanics, pilots, flight attendants, air traffic controllers, security agents, travel agents, and tour guides. It will attract national and international tourists who can explore the beauty and diversity of the region through scenic flights, excursions, and tours. The project will also improve infrastructure by building and maintaining an aerodrome, hangar, training center, and flight simulator.

Finally, AEROCOINS promotes social inclusion by offering training and employment opportunities to young people, women, and minorities who are often marginalized in the aviation sector. The project will provide scholarships, internships, mentorships, and training to individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds who have an interest and potential in aviation. The project will also encourage diversity, equality, and respect within the club and the community.
