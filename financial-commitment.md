Alice, a founding member, invested 5 million F CFA-XOF in AEROCOINS. She receives 10,000 tokens, which she can use to cover half the cost of her Private Pilot License (PPL) training. She saves 20% on her training costs and also benefits from a 5% share of the club's profits, receiving dividends based on the club's revenue. She can also enjoy discounts on aviation services, such as aircraft rental, air transport, maintenance, and refueling. She has priority for reservations, flights, exams, and licenses and can participate in exclusive events, training, and networking opportunities to improve her skills and expand her professional network.
