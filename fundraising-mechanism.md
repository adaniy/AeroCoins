Token Distribution:

Investors can acquire tokens through a secure online platform, using payment methods such as bank transfer, mobile money, and exclusively the USDT (Tether) cryptocurrency. Payment options through bank transfer and USDT ensure the stability and security of transactions. Tokens will then be transferred to digital wallets, where holders can keep, trade, or use them.

In case of project delays or failures, investors will benefit from favorable conditions and guarantees, such as:
- Full or partial refund of their investment, depending on the project's progress.
- Compensation in the form of additional tokens, based on the market exchange rate.
- Participation in the club's equity, depending on the club's asset value.

These measures aim to protect investors' interests and strengthen their confidence in the project.
